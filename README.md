**AutoLevelBotV3**

AutoLevelBot V3 is a free Discord self bot service that requires nothing other than a browser!
It can send messages to automatically gain levels on bots like MEE6.

We do not log tokens on our servers. If you are still unsure about this feel free to use an alt.

AutoLevelBotV3 can be found hosted on heroku at https://autolevelbotv3.herokuapp.com.

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/MasonTheCreeper/AutoLevelBotV3)

To use this outside of heroku you run "npm install" then after that run "node server.js" then you can use the "Live Server" plugin on Visual Studio Code to open a live server on index.html.

When running outside of heroku change 0.0.0.0 to localhost in the code.
